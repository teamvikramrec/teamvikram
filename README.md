## About the Project

**SUPER STAR** represents Team Vikram's first fully student-driven model rocket initiative. We are a passionate collective of 30 engineering students from Rajalakshmi Engineering College, committed to designing, building, testing, and launching a fully functional model rocket—establishing the foundation for future advanced rocket programs.

This repository documents all technical subsystems, simulations, designs, analyses, and management workflows of the project.

> **Our Vision:** Build rockets. Build engineers. Build the future.
